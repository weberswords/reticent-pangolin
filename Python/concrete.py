'''concrete.py

This program will estimate the cost of building a concrete
enclosure based on input from the user. User will be prompted
to provide height, width, length, size of opening, and the
 thickness of the wall to complete the final enclosure. Output
 will then display entered values as well as estimates for
 concrete, labor, overhead and total of all charges.
itâ€™s going to be done with concrete. which costs $81 per cubic meter. Labor is 60% of the concrete cost, overhead is 20% of the labor cost.
